== Keep Alives and Battery ==

TCP timeout is 15 minutes on Ubuntu.

Battery:

G1:
 * baseline - 2% / hr
 * 120 second ping - 5% / hr - 3% above baseline
 * 15 second ping - 20% / hr - 18% above baseline
 * ~5% / wakeup / minute / hour

Nexus:
 * baseline - 2% / hr
 * 60 second ping - 4% /hr - 2% above baseline
 * ~2% / wakeup / minute / hour
 

Ping:
 * Periodic keepalive alarm 120 seconds when in background
 * Faster when in foreground?
 * Check if previous ping response received
 * Send ping packet

Reconnection:
 * Don't use reconnection manager
 * Do we need WakeLock?
 * Retry during Keepalive alarm
 * Force reconnect/disconnect on NetworkState change
 * Consider signing in as Offline and waiting a few minutes before marking as online
 * Consider presence providing proxy
 * Is there a way to have a non-offline presence when disconnected?

Battery optimizations
 * See what traffic be disabled when in background
 * Proxy option
